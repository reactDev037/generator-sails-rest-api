## Getting Started

Start using generator is very simple.

First of all, you need install **yeoman** and **generator-sails-rest-api**:

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-sails-rest-api
```

Then create project directory and initiate the generator under the project directory:

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
yo sails-rest-api
```

You will be prompted for questions. Answer to those questions that generator is asks and you will get configured Sails project.

After scaffolding the project you can use this project as before. Just run the `app.js` file and all.

```bash
node app.js
```

Congratulations, you just have setup your first Sails REST API :+1:
