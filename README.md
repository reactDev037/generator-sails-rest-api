> Stability: 1 - Experimental

Yeoman generator that provides already configured and optimized Sails REST API.

## Features

- Disabled hooks by default: *cors*, *csrf*, *grunt*, *i18n*, *pubsub*, *session*, *sockets*, *views*;
- All configuration files cleaned up and optimised for REST API;
- Integrated Passport with Facebook, Twitter and Local authorizations strategies and implemented routes to them;
- Already declared `User` model with most used fields;
- Implemented 2 policies: `isOurApp` which checks if request is going from our applications, and `isUser` which checks if user is authorized by JSON Web Token;
- Custom responses which respond with `status` (Status Code), `message` (Status Message) and `response` (Response Data) fields;
- Bundle of ready-2-use services like `CipherService`, `PusherService` (Push Notifications), `SmsService` and so on... You can check table with detailed list of implemented services below;
- Integrated Mocha tests for all `controllers`, `models`, `policies`, `responses` and `services`. After generating you can execute `npm test`;
